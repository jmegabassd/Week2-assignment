# Week2-assignment

Reflection

# What requirements did you achieve?

## Design works on small mobile, and adjusts using media queries to work well on larger desktop screens (eg. above 800px).

> I designed the whole page to use grid and flex to be responsive and included an @ media to change certain elements for smaller screens.

## Correct use of alt text attribute for images

> All images were assigned a descriptive alt text tag

## Correct use of event handlers for switching the image

> The 2 event handlers switch the main image succesfully when clicked on.

# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

> I felt I managed to complete all the basic tasks, I was starting to look into the button functionallity but the complexity got to me and I had a limited ammount of time.

# What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

# What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

> Most of my problems were with JS, I can understand line by line but still putting it all together seems very complex, although easier than the start of the week. They were overcome with trial and error, cheat sheets, moodle links and alot of Google'ing... CSS I encountered some issues with styling and breaking the format of the page but I'm feeling alot more comftable using it now.

# What went really well and what could have gone better?

> Structuring the page layout with grid went very well, I turned off JS and set the two divs to have a background colour and layed my page out with this first as it was easier to visualise without the images breaking the page. As just mention the images then borke all the page layout, this caused some sweat but targeted specific div img and defined sizes which unbroke everything!

> Working with JS is definately the hardest thing for me at the moment, I have saved where I'm upto in a different project with the buttons and will be trying to figure that out in my spare time.
