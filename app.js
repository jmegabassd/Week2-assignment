//this is a repetitive task - loop - kloop through our array using the length property

// inside our loop we need to do this

// first we need to create the image element

//second we need to update the src and alt attributes of the image element to match those in the array parameters

//give each image a className (img.className)

//last we need to append the created images to the thumbnail-container

// we need an event add an event listener to each image - the event handler is the function you wirte to create large images (action to create large images)

//create and image

//update the src and alt values

//add a className for styling

//append image to the container

//addd this event handler to the thumbnail event
//you call the createThumbnail function
